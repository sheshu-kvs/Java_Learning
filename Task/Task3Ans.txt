1. Define class and object in Java with an example.
A)class: A class is the blue print of the object without the class we cannot create the objects..
an class contain the variables , methods constructor.

Object: An object is the instance of the class
the world is the collection of the objects
every object has category or type..
an object consists of the properties and the methods..

2. How do you create a constructor in Java?
A)constructor: an constructor can be created using the class name and it is does not have the return type..


3. What is the purpose of the 'this' keyword?
A)The this keyword are used to the current instance of the object and also to differentiate the current variable 
and the local variable..


4. Explain inheritance with a code example.
A)An inhertency is accquiring the properties and the methods from the one class to another class..

class A{
void disp(){
System.out.println("Class A value");
}
}
class B{

}

public class demo{
public static void main(String[] args){
B b=new B();
b.disp();
}
}

output will be the ::Class A value


5. What is method overriding? Show with example.
A) An method overriding is the where the child class is inherited from the parent class to subclass
changing the method body in the child class is called the method overriding..

Example:
class A{
void disp(){
System.out.println("Class A value");
}
}
class B extends A{
void disp(){
System.out.println("Class B value");
}

}

public class demo{
public static void main(String[] args){
B b=new B();
b.disp();
}
}

output::Class B value


6. Write a class demonstrating encapsulation.
A)Encapsulation::An Encapsulation is the Each and Every object is the very important part that is the data
data to provide the security using the private keyword and controlled access through the setters and the gettars..


Example:

Class Bank{
private int accNum;
private String Name;

public Bank(int accNum,String Name){
this.accNum=accNum;
this.Name=Name;
}

public int getId(){
return accNum;
}
public String getName(){
return Name;
}

public class demo{
public static void main(String[] args){
Bank b=new Bank(3746,"Alex");
System.out.println(b.getId());
System.out.println(b.getName());
}
}


7. What is the difference between overloading and overriding?
A)Overloading: An Method overloading is the process of the creating the multiple methods with the same name.
and Number of the parameters to be the different..
here the compiler will decide the which method should execute..

Overriding:: An Method overiding the where child class is inherited from parent class to the subclass changing 
the method body is know as the method overriding..and it will not change the return type.
here the JavaRuntime will exceute the program..


8. Create a base class Animal and a derived class Dog.

class Animal{

void eat(){
System.out.println("An Animal will eat the food");
}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void eat(){
System.out.println("Many people feed the dog with the pedgree");
}
void bark(){
System.out.println("Dog can bark..");
}
}

public class demo{
public static void main(String[] args){
Dog d=new Dog();
d.eat();
d.bark();

}
}


9. What is polymorphism in Java?
A)An polymorphisim is the greek word poly:many morph:forms like many forms
An acheive using the parent reference and the child object..



10. What is the benefit of encapsulation?
A)we are providing the security to the data using the private keyword 
consider an example:
like we have the bank account with the accNumber and pin of the account we cannot share it 
publically will provide some security to that credentials..
